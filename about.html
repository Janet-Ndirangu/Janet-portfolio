            <h2>About Me</h2>
            <p>
                I am a motivated Data Scientist with a strong academic foundation in Applied Mathematics and a recent certification in 
                Data Science and AI. In addition to my expertise in machine learning, statistical analysis, and data visualization using 
                tools like Python, TensorFlow, and Scikit-Learn, I have also explored web development and Android development. 
                These experiences have broadened my technical skill set and provided me with a well-rounded understanding of 
                software development principles. Despite being at the beginning of my career, I am eager to apply my knowledge across 
                these disciplines to contribute effectively to projects that leverage data for business insights and innovation. I am 
                committed to continuous learning and excited about the opportunity to grow within a supportive and dynamic team 
                environment.
